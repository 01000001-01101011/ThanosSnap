# ThanosSnap

When Thanos snaps, your browser freezes.  Here's the site hosted by this repository: https://tlakhan.github.io/ThanosSnap/
In case you click accidentally, you have 2 seconds to escape before you're stuck (Tip: Control + W or âŒ˜ + W to close the tab).  If you force close the browser but have restore windows enabled... good luck.
